## Current Development Focus

### Current Focus Areas


## Hyperbolic Integration Roadmap

The following steps outline the plan to integrate Qwen2.5BVL via Hyperbolic:

1. Environment Setup:
   - Install the Hyperbolic client package (e.g., via `pip install hyperbolic`).
   - Configure environment variables: `HYPERBOLIC_API_KEY` and (optionally) `HYPERBOLIC_ENDPOINT`.

2. Develop Connection Module:
   - Create a dedicated module to initialise and test connectivity with Hyperbolic.
   - Implement error handling and logging for API calls.

3. Testing and Verification:
   - Write test scripts (such as in `implementation/examples/hyperbolic_connection.py`) to list available models.
   - Confirm successful connection and proper error reporting.

4. Integration into Qwen2.5BVL Workflow:
   - Integrate the connection module with the main application to enable model inference.
   - Update documentation (README.md) with Hyperbolic integration instructions.

5. Future Enhancements:
   - Explore performance monitoring and additional API functionalities offered by Hyperbolic.
   - Schedule automated connection tests as part of CI/CD.

## Upcoming Tasks

## Notes on Tool Usage

We are prioritizing exploration and learning over pure efficiency, focusing on:

1. Building comprehensive tools

2. Understanding underlying mechanisms

3. Documenting processes thoroughly

4. Exploring various implementation approaches

This approach allows us to:

- Gain deeper understanding of the model

- Explore different tool implementations

- Document learning processes

- Create educational resources
