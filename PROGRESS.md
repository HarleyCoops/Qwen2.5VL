## Notes on Tool Usage

We are prioritizing exploration and learning over pure efficiency, focusing on:

1. Building comprehensive tools

2. Understanding underlying mechanisms

3. Documenting processes thoroughly

4. Exploring various implementation approaches

This approach allows us to:

- Gain deeper understanding of the model

- Explore different tool implementations

- Document learning processes

- Create educational resources
